# Area of Overlapping Circles
Ever wanted to find the area of multiple overlapping circles? Using this JavaScript code, you can do just that!

# How To Use
In order to use this code, all you need to do is add circles to the `circles` array at the top. The format for the array is of the following:

```
circles = [
  {x_1, y_1, r_1},
  {x_2, y_2, r_2},
  {x_3, y_3, r_3},
  ...
]
```

Where `x_n` is the x-center of the nth circle,  
`y_n` is the y-center of the nth circle,  
and `r_n` is the radius of the nth circle.
